Using the dataset from  nextspaceflight.com that includes all the space missions since the beginning of Space Race between the USA and the Soviet Union in 1957, this analysis aims to detail several trends such as:

    Who launched the most missions in any given year?

    How has the cost of a space mission varied over time?

    Which months are the most popular for launches?

    Have space missions gotten safer or has the chance of failure remained unchanged?
